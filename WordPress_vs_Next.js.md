# Key Points

Research suggests WordPress remains relevant for building new dynamic and responsive websites in 2025, with a 43.6% market share and continuous updates. It seems likely that WordPress suits non-technical users due to its ease of use, while Next.js with TailwindCSS is better for developers seeking modern performance. The evidence leans toward choosing based on project needs: WordPress for cost-effectiveness, Next.js for scalability and speed.

## Ease of Use and Suitability

WordPress is user-friendly, ideal for those without coding skills, offering a simple interface for content management. It’s great for blogs, small businesses, or sites needing quick setup. On the other hand, Next.js with TailwindCSS requires JavaScript knowledge, making it more suitable for developers building complex, high-performance sites.

## Performance and Customization

Next.js generally offers faster load times and better scalability, especially with server-side rendering. TailwindCSS enhances responsive design with utility classes. WordPress, while customizable via themes and plugins, can slow down with heavy use but is easier to manage for non-developers.

## Cost and Community Support

WordPress often has lower costs with free options, supported by a large, established community. Next.js may require more investment in development but benefits from a growing developer base and modern tools.

The discussion aims to provide a detailed comparison for informed decision-making, reflecting recent trends and data.

## Relevance of WordPress in 2025

WordPress continues to be a dominant player in website development, powering 43.6% of all websites and holding a 63% share of the CMS market, as noted in recent statistics (20+ WordPress Statistics to Know in 2025). Its relevance is underscored by frequent updates, with 3–4 major releases per year and automatic minor patches for security and performance, ensuring competitiveness (Is WordPress Still Relevant in 2025?). The platform supports over 60,000 plugins and 11,000 free themes, many optimized for mobile responsiveness and SEO, making it versatile for dynamic content like blogs, e-commerce, and user-generated features (Future of WordPress in the Next 10 Years).

Recent developments, such as the WordPress 6.7 “Rollins” update in November 2024, introduced features like the Twenty Twenty-Five theme and enhanced font management, reinforcing its adaptability (Is WordPress Dying - Should You Use in 2025?). Additionally, future plans include multilingual support through Gutenberg Phase 4, expected by 2025, expanding its global reach (The Future of WordPress: What to Expect). The WordPress economy, valued at over $10 billion annually in services, highlights its economic significance and community strength, ideal for freelancers, agencies, and small businesses (Is WordPress Still Relevant in 2025?).

However, some perspectives, like an article from 2022, suggest avoiding WordPress for business websites in 2025, favoring no-code platforms like Webflow or Squarespace for simplicity (Do NOT Use WordPress For Your Business Website In 2025). This view, though older, indicates a controversy around its suitability for modern, scalable projects, particularly with emerging technologies.

## Comparison with Next.js and TailwindCSS

When comparing WordPress to Next.js with TailwindCSS, several dimensions emerge, reflecting their differing strengths and target audiences.

### Technology Stack and Performance

WordPress operates on a PHP and MySQL backend, a traditional CMS approach that can face performance challenges with scaling, especially with numerous plugins and themes introducing bloat (WordPress vs Next.js: Unveiling the SEO and Performance Battle). In contrast, Next.js, built on React, offers server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering (CSR), enhancing speed and SEO, as highlighted in recent comparisons (Next.js vs. WordPress: Choosing the Right Tool for Your Website). TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, complements Next.js by simplifying responsive design, with over 500+ components available for rapid development (Tailwind CSS - Rapidly build modern websites).

Performance benchmarks suggest Next.js is typically faster, leveraging React’s virtual DOM for efficient rendering, while WordPress can be optimized with caching but may lag in high-traffic scenarios (Next Js Vs WordPress: Ultimate Showdown for Web Devs). This makes Next.js preferable for dynamic, interactive sites requiring real-time updates, whereas WordPress excels in content-heavy, less dynamic setups.

### Ease of Use and Target Audience

WordPress is renowned for its user-friendly admin dashboard, enabling non-technical users to create and edit content, supported by plugins like Elementor for visual building (Why WordPress still exists in 2025). This makes it ideal for bloggers, small businesses, and those needing quick setups without coding. Conversely, Next.js with TailwindCSS demands JavaScript proficiency, targeting developers who value control and modern frameworks, as seen in tutorials for building responsive sites (Building Responsive Designs with Tailwind CSS and Next.js).

The learning curve for Next.js can be steep for beginners, but it offers flexibility for custom solutions, whereas WordPress’s plugin ecosystem, while extensive, can sometimes limit advanced customizations due to theme constraints (WordPress vs React: What Should You Choose in 2024?).

### Customization and Flexibility

WordPress’s customization is driven by its vast library of themes and plugins, with over 30,000 themes available by February 2025, many built for Gutenberg and mobile optimization (Is WordPress Dying - Should You Use in 2025?). This allows for dynamic features like forms and e-commerce via plugins like WooCommerce. However, customization may require coding for advanced needs, potentially increasing complexity.

Next.js, paired with TailwindCSS, offers unparalleled flexibility through code, enabling developers to build tailored UI components and responsive designs effortlessly (Building a Responsive Website with Next.js and Tailwind CSS from Scratch). This is particularly advantageous for projects needing unique interactivity, such as employee portals or client-facing apps, as noted in community discussions (Why would someone use Next.js over Wordpress?).

### Cost and Community Support

Cost-wise, WordPress is often more affordable, with free themes and plugins, and hosting options like shared hosting reducing initial expenses (Is WordPress Good for Websites in 2024?). Its community, established over 20 years, provides extensive documentation and support, making it accessible for startups and small businesses (Top WordPress Web Development Trends for 2025).

Next.js, while potentially costlier due to development time, benefits from a growing community and modern tools, with hiring Next.js developers noted as expensive but justified for high-performance needs (Boost SEO: WordPress vs Next.JS). TailwindCSS’s integration with Next.js further reduces styling costs, offering ready-to-use components (Tailwind CSS - Rapidly build modern websites).

### Security and Scalability

Security is a concern for both, but WordPress’s popularity makes it a frequent target, mitigated by core updates and features like two-factor authentication (Is WordPress Still Relevant in 2025?). Next.js, with proper implementation, can offer robust security, especially in headless setups, but requires developer vigilance (Next.js vs WordPress: Next.js is better than WordPress 2025).

Scalability is where Next.js shines, supporting large, dynamic applications, while WordPress can scale with optimization but may face challenges with plugin bloat (WordPress, React and Next.js for Business websites: Advantages and disadvantages).

## Hybrid Approach: Headless WordPress with Next.js

An unexpected detail is the emergence of headless WordPress, where WordPress serves as a backend API, paired with Next.js for the front-end, combining content management ease with modern performance (Future of WordPress in the Next 10 Years). This hybrid approach is gaining traction, offering a middle ground for projects needing both user-friendly content management and high-performance front-ends, as discussed in recent articles (WordPress vs React: What Should You Choose in 2024?).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, WordPress remains relevant for building new dynamic and responsive websites in 2025, particularly for those prioritizing ease of use and cost-effectiveness, with a strong community and continuous updates. However, Next.js with TailwindCSS is preferable for developers seeking modern performance, scalability, and customization, though it requires coding expertise and potentially higher costs. The choice depends on project needs, with headless WordPress offering a compelling hybrid option.
